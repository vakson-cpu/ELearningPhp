This opportunity is really exciting as I will be able to learn/develop/progress in an exciting environment/industry that I am passionate about.

I have been into IT whole my life since i was a kid. After spending so much time coding througout my last 4 years of studies, I think this job will help me polish my skills even more and help me achieve things that I was always dreaming of.
